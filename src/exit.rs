//! Exit codes, for callers that are programs rather than people.
//!
//! pv is driven by other software — a site manager asking which PHP a project
//! wants, a CI script, an editor plugin. Those callers need to tell "the user
//! has not installed 8.3 yet" (install it) from "the network is down" (retry)
//! from "the checksum did not match" (stop, loudly). Collapsing all of them
//! into 1 makes that impossible, and parsing the message text instead turns
//! every reworded sentence into a breaking change.
//!
//! **These numbers are interface.** They are documented on the site and
//! asserted as literals in the tests below, so changing one fails a test
//! rather than silently breaking a caller.
//!
//! Only failures whose kind is actually known carry a code. Everything else
//! keeps exiting 1, which makes this incremental rather than a rewrite of
//! every error site.
